# Lookout

Lookout is an iOS app meant to largely simplify the scouting process for FIRST Robotics Competition teams that use team 2451's [ScoutingPASS](https://github.com/PWNAGERobotics/ScoutingPASS) scouting data system.

This app generates the data formats generated by ScoutingPASS in a neat, compact UI. All data generated by Lookout is readable by ScoutingPASS' data input system.

## FAQ

**Are you going to make an Android port?**

No. The answer will always be no. This is an app exclusive to iOS and uses SwiftUI's capabilities to achieve its UI/UX.

**Will this app be published to the App Store?**

Hopefully, yes, however it is a low priority. Right now I am not part of the Apple Developer Program, so anyone wishing to use Lookout has to sideload it themselves.
