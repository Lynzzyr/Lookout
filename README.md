# Lookout

Lookout is an iOS app developed by a member of [5409 Chargers](https://sites.google.com/hdsb.ca/garthwebrobotics/home) that is meant to largely simplify the scouting process with 5409's [ScoutingPASS](https://github.com/FRC5409/ScoutingPASS) scouting data system, a fork of 2451's original PWNAGE Analytical Strategy System.

This app generates the data formats generated by ScoutingPASS in a neat, compact UI. All data generated by Lookout is readable by ScoutingPASS' data input system.

## FAQ

**Which FRC seasons are supported?**

The following FRC seasons are supported for scouting data creation and output by Lookout:

- Crescendo (2024)

The below seasons are/will be in development:

- Reefscape (2025)
- TBD (2026)

Please note that Lookout will never support FRC seasons older than Crescendo, as there is no practical use for them.

**Will there be an Android port?**

No. The answer will always be no. This is an app exclusive to iOS and uses SwiftUI's capabilities to achieve its UI/UX.

**When is this app going to be published to the App Store?**

Hopefully, soon, however it is a low priority. Until I gain access to the Apple Developer Program, anyone wishing to use Lookout must sideload it themself.
